	<p>A flat, one-time fee of $20 is charged for the intake, which is the initial consultation between the client and the intake consultant.  The purpose of the intake is to acclimate the client to the clinic, to determine if our clinic is going to best meet his/her needs, as well as give the client the opportunity to communicate important details about his or her case in order to commence therapy.  Upon completion of the intake and the beginning of therapy, fees are based on the client&apos;s income via a sliding fee scale.</p>
