	<h3 class="contentHeading">Bilateral Agreements</h3>
	
	<p>
		East Carolina University and the following NC Community Colleges have entered into bilateral agreements for the AAS in Early Childhood Education and our BS Birth through Kindergarten program (BK). BK is a teacher education program that prepares individuals to work with infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and kindergarteners with and without disabilities, as well as those at risk children, and their families. Upon successful completion of all requirements for the program, graduates are recommended to the Department of Public Instruction for initial licensure to teach in the public schools of North Carolina. Our BK program is offered in both face-to-face and online formats.
