	<h5>What does a Medical Family Therapist do?</h5>
	
	<p>
		Medical family therapists from East Carolina University have training in research, policy, teaching, and clinical services using the biopsychosocial-spiritual approach; an approach that honors the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being of all persons in the context of their relationships.
	</p>
	
	<p>
			Medical family therapists from East Carolina University routinely include biomedical, psychosocial, and spiritual data in the collaborative research, education, treatment, and theoretical understanding of medical and mental health issues.
	</p>

	<p>
		Medical family therapists are often first trained as marriage and family therapists and are able to assess, diagnose, and provide interventions for individuals, couples, and families who have mental health concerns that are often complicated by physical symptoms, diagnoses, trauma, or loss.
