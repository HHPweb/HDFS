	<p>
		As program director, I would like to welcome you to the homepage for East Carolina University Medical Family Therapy Program.  Our program is designed to promote the field of Medical Family Therapy by training emerging leaders in theory, research, and policy in MedFT.  Our doctoral students conduct research, teach, and supervise from a relational and systemic perspective through the incorporation of a biopsychosocial-spiritual approach. Our aim is to widen the knowledge base in healthcare to include biomedical, psychosocial, and family data in the collaborative education, treatment, research, and theoretical understanding of medical and mental health issues.</p>

		<p>Please use the links above to find out more information about Medical Family Therapy in general or information about our program specifically.  Thank you for visiting us, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!</p>
