	<h5>Welcome</h5>
	
	<p>
		Welcome to the training site for Military and Veteran Family Behavioral Health Providers! We are honored to provide you with this series of continuing education modules that are intended for behavioral health providers who are already licensed or have completed their terminal degree. All of these modules will include up to date research, practices, role-plays, and reflective questions so that providers, clinicians, and extenders can build on their competency in delivering relationally based care for individuals, couples, and families. Successful completion of a module will result in a certificate, however this certificate is intended to be used for professional advancement and cannot be considered a replacement for a university based course.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Continuing Education Units (CEUs)</h5>
	
	<p>
		While some states may allow the completion of the module to serve as continuing education toward one&apos;s licensure renewal, it is up to the provider&apos;s licensure board to make that decision. Each module is worth 3.0 contact hours for 0.3 CEUs.
	</p>
	
	<h5>Course Format</h5>
	
	<p>All modules are 100% online. They include a video presentation, readings, and pre and post assessments.</p>
