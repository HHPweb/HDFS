	<p>
		The goal of the East Carolina University Family Therapy Clinic is to provide an opportunity for teaching and learning among professionals and students, and to provide high-quality services to families, couples, and individuals. By offering direct services to the public, the Clinic helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice and provides a unique service to the Greenville community and surrounding area.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		All therapists at the Clinic operate from a family systems orientation, with an appreciation for family strengths and a focus on collaborating with the family to construct solutions to their concerns. Therapists rigorously adhere to the ethical principles and standards of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) regarding confidentiality and the professional practice of marriage and family therapy. The Family Therapy Clinic is administered through the Department of Child Development and Family Relations and serves as a training site for graduate students in the Master of Science degree program on marriage and family therapy and the Doctoral program in medical family therapy.  Both programs are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE).

	<p>
		In addition to traditional marriage and family therapy (MFT) services, the Clinic provides families with the unique opportunity to be seen by therapeutic teams. This option is available various evenings per week and provides resources not commonly available in standard therapy settings. Each team is led by a clinical faculty member from the MFT program and is composed of second-year/doctoral level graduate students in family therapy/medical family therapy, and in some cases, one or two experienced therapists from various public and private agencies in the community.

	<p class="clearAll">
		While their primary therapist is seeing the family members, other members of the team observe the session from behind a one-way mirror. This arrangement offers the advantage of providing different perspectives on the family's interactions and concerns. As the therapy session progresses, the team members discuss the family's situations and offer suggestions to the primary therapist as appropriate. In addition, the team members interact directly with the family, sharing their reflections on the family's situation. With the family's permission, therapy sessions at the clinic are videotaped to allow for careful review by the treatment team, thus leading to higher quality service.
