	<p>
		The program prepares students as marriage and family therapists who are well grounded in systems theory and its application to clinical practice. The MFT program applies a diverse range of clinical and theoretical orientations that faculty members bring to the program. Particular attention is given to collaborative work with larger systems. Each student is encouraged to develop a personalized therapeutic orientation and style that integrate theory and technique. Faculty, students, and local mental health professionals work collaboratively with individuals and families on treatment teams in the ECU Family Therapy Clinic to develop and apply creative therapeutic strategies. Clinical faculty members provide weekly individual and group supervision of therapy conducted by students.

	</p>
	
	<h5>Other Requirements:</h5>
	
	<p>The MFT program includes 51 semester hours and requires full-time study over two years. Students are discouraged from maintaining a full-time job while in the program, due to the rigors associated with the curriculum. Included in this program is a year-long supervised clinical experience producing 500 contact hours with individuals, couples, and families (8-10 hours per week).</p>
	
	<p>The clinical experience requires 9 semester hours and is completed with an on-campus placement at the ECU Family Therapy Clinic and an off-campus placement at a community agency, school setting, military base, or medical setting. During their clinical experience, students have access to supervision from clinical faculty members who are AAMFT Approved Supervisors and off-campus site supervisors. While taking the practicum, students must agree to operate as family therapists, which includes working with clients during university breaks, in the evenings, and as emergencies might dictate. The clinic is open year-round to accommodate individuals, couples, and families. Students must adjust their schedules accordingly.</p>
	
	<p>*The MS degree in Marriage and Family Therapy can be obtained without a thesis although students intending to obtain their PhD are encouraged to pursue a thesis. Students who want to complete a thesis must take CDFR 7000 (thesis).</p>
