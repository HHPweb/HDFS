		&quot;Like any first time parents, we were anxious, nervous, and unsure about how anyone could care and love our son the way we could. However, we can say without a doubt that we feel Max has been loved and cared for by your staff as if he were their own... Also, we love the program&apos;s philosophy, the active engagement of arts, crafts, and outdoor physical activity time that you are committed too. Max is truly engaged every day mentally, physically, and emotionally.&quot;<br />
