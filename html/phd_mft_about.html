	<h3 class="contentHeading">PhD in Medical Family Therapy - About Our Program</h3>
	
	<p>
		The first ever doctoral program in Medical Family Therapy (MedFT) was established at East Carolina University (ECU) in fall 2005 and graduated the first group of MedFT doctoral students in the nation in May of 2008. The mission of the doctoral program in Medical Family Therapy (MedFT) is to advance students learning in the areas of research, theory, clinical practice, leadership, supervision, and teaching in order to prepare and qualify them to pursue employment as researchers, educators, administrators, and/or clinicians in the field of medical family therapy. Our doctoral students conduct research, teach, and supervise from a relational and systemic perspective through the incorporation of a biopsychosocial-spiritual approach. The aim is to widen the knowledge base in healthcare to include biomedical, psychosocial, and family data in the collaborative education, treatment, research, and theoretical understanding of medical and mental health issues.

			<strong>On November 17, 2007, the Doctor of Philosophy in Medical Family Therapy was accredited by COAMFTE (Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education), which made it the first accredited MedFT program in the United States. The program was reaccredited in 2013.</strong>
