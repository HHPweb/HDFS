		Established in 1988, the master's program in marriage and family therapy (MFT) at East Carolina University (ECU) was the first MFT program in North Carolina that was accredited by the Commission on Accreditation (COAMFTE) of the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). The program was last reaccredited in November of 2007.
